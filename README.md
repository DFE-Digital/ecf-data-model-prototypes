# CPD data prototypes

This is a set of data model prototypes that we intend to test out. They will be used to inform the next steps for the CPD programme's data schema, whether that is a rewrite or heavy refactor.

## Data

The same data will be expressed in each of the prototypes so queries can be directly compared.
